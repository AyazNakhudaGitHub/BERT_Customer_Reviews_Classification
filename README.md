A machine learning research project by: Ayaz Nakhuda, David Ferris and Jastejpal Soora 



To run these files one would need to save the .ipynb files onto Google Drive along with the data and saved models. All of the files, data and saved models need to be in the same directory on Google Drive. Furthermore, the .ipynb notebooks will need to be opened on Google Colab where one would run the cells. It is reccomended to purchase Colab Pro as they provide access to capable GPU's and TPU's and more resources. 




Unfortunately, we cannot provide the data and the saved models as Github does not allow us to upload files greater than 25MB. However, you can send an email to ayaz.nakhuda@ryerson.ca to request such materials.
